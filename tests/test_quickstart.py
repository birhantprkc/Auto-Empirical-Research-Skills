"""Tests for the five-minute tour (`make quickstart`).

The tour is the first thing a newcomer runs, so a wrong number there is the
worst place to have one. It had two: it counted the markdown table's separator
row as a method family (reporting 19 instead of 18, with `---` in the sample
list), and it labelled the *total* family count as the *closed-coverage* count,
which are different numbers with different meanings.

Both came from the same shortcut — parsing a generated table by eye rather than
by its shape — so these tests check the parse against the generated document it
reads, not against a hardcoded expectation.
